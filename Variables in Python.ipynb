There are different types of expressions in Python like : *arithmetic expressions*, *string expressions*, *relational expressions*, *logical expressions* and *compound expressions*. Let's learn about these one by one. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arithmetic Expressions : Arithmetic expressions involve numbers (integers, floating-point numbers or complex numbers) and arithmetic operators. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; For example : a = 2+4, b = 8.4 - 4.5 etc.<br> <br>\n",
    "2. Relational Expressions : An expression which have literals and/or variables of valid type and relational operators is a relational expression. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; For example : a > b, c <= d, x == y etc. <br> <br>\n",
    "3. Logical Expressions : An expression which have literals and/or variables of valid type and logical operators is a logical expression. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; For example : a and b, c or d, x and not y etc. <br> <br>\n",
    "4. String Expresions : In python, we also have two operators + and \\* which when used with string operands form string expressions. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; For example: \"for\"+\"them\" beacomes \"forthem\" (concatenation operation) and \"hi\"\\*2 becomes \"hihi\"(replication operation). <br> <br>\n",
    "5. Compound Expressions : If an expression involves multiple types of operators then it is called a compound expression. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; For example a+b < c\\*\\*d is a compound expression as it involves *arithmetic operators* as well as *relational operators*.  <br> <br> \n",
    "You will learn about expression evaluation when we will discuss about different types of operators avaiable in python language.  <br>\n",
