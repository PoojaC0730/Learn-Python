    "- Python has very portable freely available library and they are platform compatible. <br>\n",
    "- Easy for debugging and testing. <br>\n",

    "If you are familiar with coding in general you would know that there are some reserved words in a programming language. These reserved words are also called keywords. These keywords have a special meaning and they are used for special purposes in Python programming language. These keywords cannot be used as name for a variable, function, class or as any other identifier. They are used in syntax and structure of a python program. Python is a case-sensitive language which means *Name* and *name* are two different identifiers in python. <br>\n",
