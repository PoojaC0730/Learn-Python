    "## Operator Precedence in Python\n",
    "In python, when we combine values, variables, operators or functions it forms an expression. And once the expression is executed the python interpreter check the validity of that expression. We have discussed about different types of expressions like *arithmetic expressions*, *string expressions*, *relational expressions*, *logical expressions* and *compound expressions*. Now we will look into how an expression is evaluated in python. <br> For example: '4 + 7' is a valid python expression with values 4 and 7 and operator '+'. But this is the simplest form of expression. An expression might contain multiple values, variables and operators then to decide the evaluation order python gives operator precedence chart which shows which operator will be evaluated first and which last. Python interpreter follows this precedence order and moves from left to right while evaluating an expression. <br> Given below is the precedence order of python operators from highest to the lowest precedence. <br>\n",
